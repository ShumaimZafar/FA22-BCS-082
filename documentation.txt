Shumaim Class Documentation:

1. Overview:
   The 'Shumaim' class contains implementations for three distinct functionalities:
   - Sorting an array of integers in descending order.
   - Calculating statistics (median, variance, standard deviation, sum of squares) for an array of integers.
   - Performing matrix multiplication for two 2D matrices.

2. Methods:
   a. `main` method:
      - Entry point of the program.
      - Demonstrates the usage of the implemented functionalities.

   b. `sortDescending` method:
      - Sorts an array of integers in descending order.
      - Utilizes `Arrays.sort` and array element swapping.

   c. `calculateStatistics` method:
      - Calculates statistics for an array of integers.
      - Statistics include median, variance, standard deviation, and sum of squares.
      - Uses basic statistical formulas without external libraries.

   d. `matrixMultiplication` method:
      - Performs matrix multiplication for two 2D matrices.
      - Validates matrix dimensions and throws an exception for invalid cases.
      - Utilizes nested loops to compute the product matrix.

3. Example Usage:
   - The 'main' method provides example usages for each functionality:
      - Sorting an array in descending order.
      - Calculating statistics for an array of integers.
      - Performing matrix multiplication for two matrices.

4. Dependencies:
   - The class relies on the 'java.util.Arrays' class for sorting arrays.

5. Author:
   - The code is authored by 'Shumaim'.

6. Version:
   - Current version is '1.0'.
